    "Trace route, or tracert for short, is a command-line utility ussed to trace the network route packets take to reach a specific destination. On windows it's \"tracert\" on unix-like systems (Linux, MacOS) it's \"traceroute\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracert works by sending a series of packets to the destination, gradually increasing the Time To Live (TTL) value of each packet. The TTL is a limit on how many \"hops\" a packet can take before it's discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "First Packet (TTL = 1): The first packet has a TTL of 1, which means it will likely expire after the first hop (the first router it encounters). The router then sends an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) \"Time Exceeded\" message back to the sender (this computer). tracert records the IP address and the round-trip time RTT of this router.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues with the TTL increasing by one for each packet, until the packet reaches its final destination. When the destination is reached, it responds with an ICMP \"Echo Reply\" message.\n",
